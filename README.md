# Minto-Pack
*Mint Fantome Resource Pack*

A fanmade resource pack taking inspiration from indie vtuber Mint Fantome

As of now, the only changes it brings is reskinning zombies to look like Mint and replacing their audios with hers.

To install the resource pack, download "Minto Resource Pack" and ensure that it remains as a non-zipped folder. In the Minecraft menu, open up the resource packs folder and drag the Minto Resource pack there.
